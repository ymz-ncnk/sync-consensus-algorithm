# sync-consensus-algorithm
Here you can find two consensus algorithms:
- [Sync](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm/blob/main/Sync%20Consensus%20Algorithm.md) - designed for systems that use only a distributed log.
- [Syncfull](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm/blob/main/Syncfull%20Consensus%20Algorithm.md) - is an extension of the Sync algorithm, designed for systems that 
  use a state machine in addition to the distributed log.
