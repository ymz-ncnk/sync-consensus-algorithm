# sync-consensus-algorithm
Here you can find two consensus algorithms:
- [Sync](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm/blob/main/Sync%20Consensus%20Algorithm.md) - replicates a distributed log.
- [Syncfull](https://github.com/ymz-ncnk/sync-consensus-algorithm/blob/main/Syncfull%20Consensus%20Algorithm.md) - Sync + state machine.
